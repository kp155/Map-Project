        <h4>The Undemocratic Senate </h4>
        <p>
          As the upper chamber of Congress, the United States Senate is one of the most powerful institutions in the country. It also one of the most severely undemocratic. With each state allocated two senators regardless of population size,
          disparities in resident voting power have been built into the nation’s system of governance. Residents of states with larger populations have effectively less representation in the Senate than residents of states with smaller populations.
          The map displayed above quantifies the voting power of residents of each state, with residents of the least populated state, Wyoming, having the strongest vote. Residents of California have the least amount of representation in the Senate,
          despite having a population equivalent to the 20 least populated states. Jonah Birch is a political sociology professor at Appalachian State University and views the Senate as a major obstacle to legislating on behalf of a democratic
          majority.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Particulary as there is a growing partisan polarization between rural and urban America, the Senate has given disproportional representation to rural and conservative communities.”
        </p>
        <p>

          As of today, the latest attempt by Congress to pass a federal stimulus package, including expanded financial aid for unemployed Americans, has been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
